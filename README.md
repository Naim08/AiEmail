# MailTo

MailTo is a website that uses AI technology to assist users in crafting appropriate email responses.

## Background and Overview

In today's fast-paced digital world, communication has become both instantaneous and voluminous. With the rise in electronic communication, businesses and professionals face an overwhelming number of emails on a daily basis. While timely responses enhance customer satisfaction and professionalism, crafting thoughtful and appropriate responses requires time and effort. Many businesses face a challenge: how to maintain efficient communication without compromising on quality.

Recognizing the need for efficient, consistent, and high-quality email responses, a team of engineers came together to conceptualize MailTo. "MailTo" is an innovative AI-driven platform designed to assist users in crafting appropriate and effective email responses.

## Functionality and MVP

- [ ] User authorization: sign up and log in
- [ ] User Preference Input: This feature allows users to set and customize their preferences for email interactions.
- [ ] CRUD Email Session: This feature enables users to initiate a new email session, view existing ones, edit email contents or settings, and delete sessions no longer needed.
- [ ] AI-Generated Response: Based on the incoming email content and user preferences, the system will generate an appropriate email response, which users can choose to use, modify, or discard.
- [ ] Search Previous Email: Allows users to search through their past emails (sent or received) using keywords.

### Bonus Features
- [ ] Sending Email: Once the user is satisfied with the email content, they can send it directly from the platform.

## Technologies and Technical Challenges

MailTo is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). The technologies we will use:

- Backend: Express with Node.js
- Frontend: React, Redux
- Database: MongoDB
- AI and Machine Learning: OpenAI GPT
- Authentication: JWT
- Email Integration: Services like SendGrid, Mailgun.

#### Technical Challenges:

-   Backend: Express with Node.js

    *   Performance: Node.js runs on a single-threaded event loop. CPU-bound tasks can block the event loop and degrade performance.
    *   Error Handling: Proper handling of synchronous and asynchronous errors in Express routes and middleware.
-   Frontend: React, Redux
    *   Component Optimization: Ensuring that React components don't re-render unnecessarily. Techniques like memoization can help.
    *   State Management: Handling complex application state with Redux requires a good understanding of actions, reducers, and store.
-   Database: MongoDB
    *   Data Consistency: MongoDB uses eventual consistency, which might cause issues in situations where strict consistency is required.
    *   Query Performance: Without proper indexing, query performance can degrade, especially with large datasets.
-   AI and Machine Learning: OpenAI GPT
    *   Integrating OpenAI's GPT with your backend to generate responses in real-time.
    *   Model Tuning: Ensuring the AI model gives relevant and appropriate email responses.
    *   Cost Management: AI inference can be expensive. Monitoring and managing API call costs.
-   Authentication: JWT
    *   Token Security: Ensuring JWT tokens are stored securely (e.g., not in local storage due to XSS attacks).
